Browser "Workers"
- Web Worker
- Service Worker

Both share common features:
- run in their own threads (analogous to simplified "actors")
- no access to DOM or other synchronous web APIs (localStorage, cookies)
- access to IndexedDB
- postMessage API for both-ways asynchronous communication with the main thread

There can be many Web Workers per website at the same time, but exactly zero or one Service Worker.
