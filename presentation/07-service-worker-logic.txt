1. Service Worker, when installed, on subsequent visits serves the cached content first.
2. Then, it checks for updates (whether there's a newer service worker on the server).
   IMPORTANT! Never change a name of service worker's script. NEVER!
3. In case there is newer content, it can notify about that - user should reload page.
4. If the service worker is also responsible for caching static assets,
   then if either of these assets has changed, newest version of service worker should have that asset's
   unique name updated.
