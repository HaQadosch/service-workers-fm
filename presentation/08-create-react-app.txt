A tale of service workers in Create-React-App
- static assets caching service worker (generated with webpack plugin) exists in current version of popular Create-React-App;
- initially, there were a lot of problems due to mistake - asset-caching service worker installed on localhost - in turn the app
  was running even after the development server was taken down (confused people would even remove node from OS but still see the app
  running due to service worker living in their browsers);
- a long thread on github with people arguing for & against service worker in CRA;
- Dan Abramov on Twitter:
  "Service workers are opt-in in the next version of Create React App.
   They are an amazing technology but the pitfalls today are too significant to be a good default.
   Will revisit in a year or two!"
