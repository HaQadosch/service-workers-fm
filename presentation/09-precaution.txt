Service worker is like a chainsaw. 
It's generally an awesome tool, but if not used cautiously, it can cut your (and others') limbs off.

- analogy taken from this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPP9ew4Co0M
- developers have to be REALLY CAREFUL when using service workers;
- if used inappropriately, it can "infect" users' browsers and turn the app practically unusable
- it's very difficult to explain to users how to uninstall such "trojan horse"
