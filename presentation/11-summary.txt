- One does not achieve "offline-first" by simply installing a service worker - it's rather a set of architecture design rules to follow;
- Weird behaviour might occur if the app is cached for offline use, but does not provide any mechanism for intercepting ajax requests;
- This might result in half-broken app;
- Service workers used properly have definitely great advantages. Misused - huge consequences.
